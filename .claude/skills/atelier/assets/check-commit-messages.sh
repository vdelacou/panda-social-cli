# atelier commit-message CI gate - re-check Conventional Commits server-side
#
# The `commit-msg` hook (assets/commit-msg) is the local first line, and
# `git commit --no-verify` walks straight past it. This re-runs the identical
# grammar over every commit in the pushed range, on the one line that cannot be
# skipped, exactly as the CI gate set backstops the fast pre-commit hook
# (rule 23; canon 1.3 "One grammar for the history", which asks for the linter
# in the fast hook AND a re-check in CI).
#
# One grammar, one validator: this delegates to the hook script instead of
# restating the pattern, so the local gate and the CI gate cannot drift apart.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-commit-messages.sh [range]
#
# The range defaults to the GitHub Actions context: the PR's base branch on a
# pull request, and on a push the commits the push added (GITHUB_EVENT_BEFORE,
# exported by the shipped workflow from github.event.before). On a push to the
# trunk HEAD already IS origin/main, so that older default was an empty range
# that passed vacuously, the CI half of rule 23 checking nothing on the
# trunk-based workflow the standard mandates. Locally it is origin/main..HEAD.
# Pass one explicitly to check any other span. Merge commits are excluded; the
# hook's own exemptions (Revert, fixup!, squash!, amend!) still apply.
#
# Installed alongside the other gate scripts:
#
#   cp <skill>/assets/check-commit-messages.sh scripts/check-commit-messages.sh
#
# See skills/atelier/references/workflow.md (Commit message format).
