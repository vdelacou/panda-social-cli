# Rule 26 tripwire: identity lives in commit metadata, never in file contents.
#
# Checks the STAGED ADDED LINES (like the staged secret scan), so it blocks
# a mention entering history without flooding a brownfield tree. `--all` scans
# every tracked text file instead (CI, and the adopt-mode audit).
#
# What it looks for, case-insensitively, as whole words:
#   - the committer's full name, in both orders (git config user.name)
#   - the committer's email (git config user.email)
#   - under --all, every author and committer name and email in the history
#   - every entry of IDENTITY_DENYLIST (newline- or comma-separated: employer
#     and client names). An environment variable, never a tracked file, since a
#     tracked denylist would itself name what the rule forbids.
# A one-word git name is a handle, which rule 26 permits, and is skipped; so is
# a GitHub noreply address (<handle>@users.noreply.github.com). CODEOWNERS and
# .mailmap are exempt: rule 26 names them as the two places a person belongs.
# A lone first name stays a review duty: a one-word match would flag "will"
# and "grace" in prose.
#
# This is a tripwire, not a proof. A hit is a hard stop; the fix is a neutral
# handle, never an inline suppression (rule 15).
#
#   bash scripts/check-identity.sh          # staged added lines (the hook)
#   bash scripts/check-identity.sh --all    # every tracked text file (CI, adopt audit)
