"""The reply gate: does an agent's reply to a person read the way the Interaction section asks?

The atelier skill's SKILL.md, Interaction, says how a reply reads. Five of its rules are
mechanical enough to match, and they are the doctrine tags:

  em-dash         U+2014 in the reply's own prose
  cut-word        the section's cut list: delve, leverage, robust, seamless, nuanced, "it's worth noting"
  bold-lead-in    a list item that opens on a bold phrase and carries on past it
  emoji           a pictograph or dingbat (U+1F000-1FAFF, U+2600-27BF), less the check and
                  cross marks U+2713-2718, which a status table uses as glyphs
  heading-case    a Title Case heading: two or more capitalised content words, none lowercase

The gate, --hook, is a Claude Code Stop hook (assets/claude-settings.json wires it). It reads the
Stop event on stdin and checks the reply in its last_assistant_message field, or the transcript's
last reply where an older Claude Code sends no such field (the docs warn the transcript can lag).
A doctrine finding exits 2 with each tag and its fix on stderr: Claude Code hands that text back to
the agent, which sends the reply again, fixed. The second stop carries stop_hook_active and passes,
so a reply is restated at most once and the gate never loops. Exit 0 passes; exit 1 is stdin that
is not a Stop event, a visible hook error and never a silent pass. It needs only python3.

The probe, file or directory arguments, reads replies after the fact and counts every tag; a
doctrine finding exits 1. On transcripts it also counts the gate's own blocks per session, read
from the feedback Claude Code hands back: blocks, the ones after a session's first, and the
restatements that still broke a rule. Its candidate tags come from Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100
Issue 7, read through the 0xpili/simplified-technical-english skill on 2026-10-04). They are not
doctrine and never block or fail: they are counted so an Interaction edit lands only where agents
miss, and 831 real replies showed no habit for any of them (2026-10-04).

  unverified-claim  a result stated as a hedge: "should pass", "probably fixed", "might be green"
  hedge             any other should, would, might, may, could, probably, likely, possibly,
                    perhaps, presumably, hopefully, seem(s), appear(s) to; STE keeps only can,
                    must and will ("could not" is a past fact, and a question asks rather than
                    claims: both pass)
  passive           an event passive: was, were, been or being plus a participle ("the tests
                    were updated"); "is disconnected" names a state and passes, as in STE
  long-sentence     over 25 words, STE's cap for descriptive text; a parenthesis counts as one word
  long-paragraph    over 6 sentences
  buried-ask        a question in a prose paragraph that also carries two or more report sentences

Inputs, any mix; no argument reads one reply from stdin:
  - a text or Markdown file is one reply (review-eval's .review.txt, a pasted answer)
  - a .jsonl transcript: each assistant text block is one reply, from the claude -p stream-json the
    conformance and distill evals keep or a Claude Code session log under ~/.claude/projects/;
    thinking, tool calls, user turns, subagent messages and the harness's own notices (model
    <synthetic>: an API error, a /context table) are not replies and are skipped
  - a directory is walked for both; a .result.txt beside a .transcript.jsonl is skipped (it is
    derived from it), and so are the skills/, subagents/, node_modules/ and .git/ subtrees

Code, block quotes, URLs and double-quoted text (a mention, not a use) are never read, emphasis
markers are dropped, and a table row gets the doctrine character checks only. In the skill's own
evals the conformance prompt asks for a bare file list as the final reply, so its transcripts carry
prose only in the narration between tool calls: review-eval's reviews, distill-eval's summaries
and real session logs are the inputs that say most. Counts roll up per arm, read from a run dir's
with_skill or baseline suffix ("-" elsewhere). Each tag is a pattern, not a parser: read the
findings before the counts.
