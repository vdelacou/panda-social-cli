# Gate: the vendored copy of the standard must not be silently stale.
#
# A repo that vendors or pins this skill has taken a dependency on doctrine,
# and it goes stale exactly like a library does: quietly, while every other
# gate stays green. The 2026-08-30 field test found a consumer running a
# 49-day-old copy, so its hook still ran the retired eight-gate design and its
# rule 26 read the superseded wording. Nothing was broken; the repo was
# faithfully following a standard that had moved.
#
# Like the CVE scan, this belongs on a schedule and not on a commit: upstream
# doctrine changes independently of your diff, so blocking an unrelated commit
# because a skill landed overnight fails in the wrong place (references/
# workflow.md, Dependency scanning).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-skill-pin.sh [path-to-vendored-skill]
#     default: .claude/skills/atelier, the whole tree (SKILL.md, references,
#     assets), compared file by file. A vendored standard is a tree: the
#     references carry the detail SKILL.md points at and the assets ARE the
#     gates, so a check that reads only SKILL.md can report "current" over a
#     stale reference (the gate-that-cannot-fail shape, canon 15.10; seen on
#     a real consumer 2026-08-30).
#   SKILL_PIN_UPSTREAM   where the current standard lives, one of:
#     - a local directory: the skill dir of a checkout
#     - a git repository URL (https://..., git@..., file://...), cloned shallowly;
#       SKILL_PIN_SUBDIR (default skills/atelier) is the skill dir inside it
#     - a single file, local path or raw URL ending in .md: SKILL.md only, and
#       the report says the references and assets are then NOT covered
#     The shipped audit workflow sets it to the public repository; point it at
#     a fork if you keep one. Unset, the check cannot run and says so.
#   SKILL_PIN_SUBDIR     the skill dir inside a cloned repository (default skills/atelier)
#
# Degrades gracefully: no vendored copy, no upstream configured, or no network,
# exits 0 with a note. Being unable to check is not the same as being current,
# so the note says so.
