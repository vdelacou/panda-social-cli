# Run PIT on the classes that changed under domain/ and usecases/ (plus any
# uncommitted edits and untracked files): the mutation step of the Java CI
# gate (assets/ci-java.yml, every pull request and push). The full sweep is
# never a commit gate; assets/mutation-java.yml runs it once a day. The Java
# twin of mutate-changed.sh, same base resolution, same loud failures.
#
# The base ref: BASE= wins; under GitHub Actions the range is the pull
# request's base branch or, on a push, github.event.before..HEAD (ci-java.yml
# exports it as GITHUB_EVENT_BEFORE; the zero SHA of a new branch and an
# unresolvable SHA fall back to HEAD~1). Elsewhere the default is origin/main.
# Skip the ref refresh with MUTATE_NO_FETCH=1.
#
# The canonical pom reads `<targetClasses>${pitest.targetClasses}</targetClasses>`
# with the two package globs as the property default, so this script narrows
# the run by overriding the property with the changed classes' names.
#
# See skills/atelier/references/java-quarkus.md (Testing; Gates and hooks).
