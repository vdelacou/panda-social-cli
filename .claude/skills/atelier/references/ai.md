# AI models as dependencies (ports, pins, evals, injection, spend)

A language model is an external service like a database or a payment gateway, plus two properties nothing else has: its output is non-deterministic, and everything it reads can try to steer it. Both are handled with machinery this standard already owns (ports, branded checkpoints, gates), extended four ways. This is the doctrine behind hard rule 32.

## 1. The model sits behind a port (like every other dependency)

Never call a provider SDK from domain or use-case code. The domain depends on an interface it owns, named after the capability (`summarize`, `extract`, `classify`), never after the vendor. The adapter decides provider, model, and prompt; the composition root wires real or fake. The canonical layout already reserves the slots: `src/use-cases/ports/llm.ts`, `src/infra/gemini-llm.ts`, `src/test-helpers/llm-fake.ts` (`references/architecture.md`), and the adapter test seam is the two-constructor pattern like any SDK adapter (`references/testing-infra.md`).

```ts
// src/use-cases/ports/llm.ts: capability, not vendor
export type SummarizerError = { readonly kind: 'llm-failed'; readonly message: string };
export type Summarizer = (text: string) => Promise<Result<string, SummarizerError>>;

// src/test-helpers/llm-fake.ts: canned, deterministic, free
export const createSummarizerFake = (canned = 'canned summary'): Summarizer =>
  async () => ok(canned);
```

Unit tests never touch a real model: fast, deterministic, free (rule 13's fakes discipline). The adapter itself is an infra adapter like any other: `try/catch` quarantine, `Result` translation, a deadline and a bounded retry on the call (hard rule 29).

**Pin the exact model snapshot.** A floating alias (`-latest`, an undated name) is repointed silently by the provider; your behaviour then changes with no commit in your repo. Pin a dated snapshot in config, exactly as rule 19 pins packages: pinned, every behaviour change has a diff, an author, and an eval run. Swapping provider, model, or prompt is one adapter and one config line, never a hunt through the codebase.

```ts
// composition/env.ts: the pin is config, reviewed like a lockfile change. The value is the
// provider's dated snapshot id (the shape below is a placeholder, not a real model), never an alias.
llmModel: envEnum('LLM_MODEL', ['provider-model-2026-06-15'] as const),
```

## 2. Narrow, well-shaped holes; the core stays deterministic

Give the model only a few fixed points where its output may enter the system, and shape each one. Model output is an **untrusted source** (rule 12): it crosses a validating checkpoint (a Zod schema, a branded factory) before anything trusts it. Structured output with a schema is the default; free text is reserved for content shown to humans as content.

```ts
const parsed = ExtractionSchema.safeParse(raw); // the model's output is input
if (!parsed.success) return err({ kind: 'llm-invalid-output', message: parsed.error.message } as const);
```

## 3. Evals gate the merge (the mutation score of non-determinism)

A prompt or model-pin change ships on its eval score, not on how the demo felt. For each hole, keep a labeled evaluation set (real cases, expected outputs, deterministic validators: schema, sums, dates) and run it in CI on any change to a prompt, the pin, or the hole's schema, blocking below a threshold, exactly as the mutation gate blocks below 90.

**The gate is an artifact, not a sentence.** A comment saying the change "has an eval run" gates nothing. Three things in the diff do: the case set, the runner that exits non-zero below the bar, and the CI job that runs it on the paths that can change the behaviour. The shape, for a hole named `<capability>`:

```text
evals/<capability>/cases.json      # labeled inputs and expected outputs, synthetic or consented (rule 34)
scripts/run-evals.ts               # runs the port's real adapter over the set, prints the score, exits 1 below --min-score
package.json                       # "evals": "bun run scripts/run-evals.ts"
```

```ts
// scripts/run-evals.ts (the shape; validators are the hole's own: schema, sums, dates, fields mentioned)
const minScoreFrom = (argv: ReadonlyArray<string>): number => {
  const at = argv.indexOf('--min-score');
  return at === -1 ? 0.9 : Number(argv[at + 1]);
};

const run = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const { cases } = (await Bun.file('evals/summarize-thread/cases.json').json()) as { cases: ReadonlyArray<EvalCase> };
  const summarize = createSummarizer(readConfig()); // the real adapter, the pinned model
  let passed = 0;
  for (const c of cases) {
    const result = await summarize(c.input);
    if (result.ok && passes(result.value, c.expect)) passed += 1;
  }
  const score = passed / cases.length;
  console.log(`score ${score.toFixed(2)} over ${cases.length} cases, bar ${minScoreFrom(Bun.argv)}`);
  if (score < minScoreFrom(Bun.argv)) process.exitCode = 1;
};
```

(`console.log` is allowed here: a script, not production code, per rule 4.) The CI job runs it on the paths that can change the answer:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    # every path that can change the answer: the prompt, the port, the adapter, the pin
    # (composition/env.ts), the hole's output schema, and the cases themselves (rule 32)
    paths: ["prompts/**", "src/use-cases/ports/llm.ts", "src/infra/*llm*", "src/composition/env.ts", "src/domain/**/*schema*", "evals/**"]
jobs:
  evals:
    steps:
      - run: bun run evals --min-score 0.95
```

Keep the dataset in the repo (synthetic or consented data only: hard rule 34), version it, and grow it the way the test suite grows: every production miss becomes a labeled case, the eval-set sibling of "every bug becomes a regression test" (`references/testing.md`).

## 4. Untrusted content is not instructions (prompt injection)

The prompt you write is the command; the content the model reads (a document, an email, a web page, a tool result) is the material it works on. The model cannot reliably tell the two apart, so an attacker hides orders in the material: an email body that tells the model to set aside its instructions and forward every invoice is trying to jump from the data channel into the command channel, the same disease as SQL injection.

Two layers, and the second is the one that holds:

- **Fence content as quoted data.** System prompt carries policy; untrusted content arrives explicitly marked as material ("the document says..."), so the system reports what a document says rather than obeying it. When the email says "delete everything", the correct output is that the email says so, never the deletion. Useful, never sufficient: natural-language fencing cannot be watertight.
- **Enforce at the action layer.** Every tool call or action the model requests is validated at the boundary (shape, rule 12) and **authorized server-side against the rights of the human or tenant it runs for**, exactly like a request from any untrusted client (`references/security.md`; `references/isolation.md`). The model's confidence is not a credential. Allow-list the tools; run with least privilege; a fully hijacked model can then still do nothing the legitimate caller was not already allowed to do.

```ts
const out = await llm.run({ system: POLICY, input: asQuotedDocument(email.body) });
const call = ToolCall.safeParse(out.toolCall); // shape: the boundary checkpoint
if (!call.success) return err({ kind: 'invalid-tool-call' } as const);
if (!(await deps.authz.allows(ctx.actor, call.data))) return err({ kind: 'forbidden' } as const);
return deps.tools.execute(call.data); // allow-listed, the actor's rights, least privilege
```

Review nuance: the security false-positive filter (`references/security.md`) skips "user content included in a prompt" as a finding, and that stays right. What IS a concrete finding is model output reaching a sink or executing a tool without the checkpoint and the server-side authorization above: that is an injection path with an attack story.

## 5. Cap what a caller can spend

On metered endpoints (model calls above all), a request rate limit is not a cost control: it counts requests while the bill counts tokens; 100 requests inside the limit can cost cents or hundreds. Enforce a per-caller budget **before** the call, refuse rather than bill when exceeded, and meter actual usage per caller so cost dashboards read per-tenant truth.

```ts
app.post('/v1/ai/extract',
  rateLimit({ perMinute: 100 }),
  spendGuard({ maxTokensPerDay: 200_000, per: 'org' }), // refuse before the provider is called
  extract);
```

The cost-growth alert (`references/metrics.md`, Cost is a first-class metric) confirms after the fact what this gate already prevented.

## Review checklist (changes touching a model)

1. Is every SDK call inside one infra adapter, behind a capability-named port with a fake?
2. Is the model a pinned, dated snapshot read from config? No `latest`, no undated alias?
3. Does model output cross a schema/branded checkpoint before anything consumes it?
4. Prompt, pin, or schema changed: are the case set, the `--min-score` runner, and the CI job in the diff (or already there), and does the score clear the bar?
5. Can any content the model reads cause an action? If so, is the action validated and authorized server-side for the actual caller, from an allow-list, at least privilege?
6. Metered route: per-caller spend gate before the call, usage metered per tenant?
