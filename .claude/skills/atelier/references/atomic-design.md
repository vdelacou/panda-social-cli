# Atomic Design: the logic-free design system

Applies to every repo with React UI (Next.js monorepo variant). Read this before creating or modifying anything under `src/components/`, `src/page/`, or `src/lib/{hooks,layout}/`.

The design system is a standalone catalogue of presentational components. It renders props. It decides nothing, fetches nothing, stores nothing, and imports nothing from the application around it. All intelligence (state, data loading, routing, i18n, analytics) lives outside the design system and arrives through props. And the wall runs both ways: just as no application knowledge enters the design system, no styling knowledge leaves it. Tailwind is invisible outside `src/components/**`. The Next.js side does not know the project uses Tailwind. This is SKILL.md hard rules 21 and 22, and it is non-negotiable.

Why the hard line:

- **Portability.** Components that depend only on `react` render anywhere: any router, Storybook, a marketing microsite, a test with no providers.
- **Refactor freedom.** The app can swap its state management, i18n library, or data source without touching a single component file, and redesign a component without touching behaviour.
- **Restyle freedom.** Styling lives only in the design system, so a full rebrand touches `src/components/**` and the design tokens, never a page, hook, route, or config file. Swapping the styling engine itself leaves the app byte-identical.
- **Reviewability.** A diff under `src/components/**` is a pure visual diff. If one PR changes a component *and* application behaviour, the boundary has leaked.

## The five levels, mapped to directories

Brad Frost's hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages) maps onto the repo like this:

| Level | Directory | Responsibility | May import |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Atoms | `src/components/atoms/` | Smallest primitives: button, badge, icons. No internal composition, only HTML elements. | `react` only |
| Molecules | `src/components/molecules/` | Small groupings: article-card, breadcrumbs, section-header, language-switcher. | atoms, `react` |
| Organisms | `src/components/organisms/` | Full page sections: hero, faq, pricing, nav-bar, footer. | atoms, molecules, `react` |
| Templates | `src/lib/layout/` | Layout shells and framework wrappers shared across pages. | anything |
| Pages | `src/page/` | Page shells consumed by `app/(lang)/page.tsx`. Own all state and wiring. | anything |

**Imports point strictly upward.** An atom never imports a molecule. A molecule never imports an organism. Nothing inside `src/components/**` imports from `src/lib/**`, `src/config/**`, `src/page/**`, `app/**`, or any framework module (`next/link`, `next/image`, `next/navigation`). The only allowed imports inside the design system are `react` (types and JSX runtime) and lower design-system layers.

One component per kebab-case folder, component in `index.tsx`, PascalCase named export, exported props type, `displayName` set:

```
src/components/
├── atoms/
│   ├── button/index.tsx          # exports Button, ButtonProps
│   ├── badge/index.tsx
│   └── icons/arrow-right-icon.tsx
├── molecules/
│   └── article-card/index.tsx    # exports ArticleCard, ArticleCardProps
└── organisms/
    └── pricing/index.tsx         # exports Pricing, PricingProps
```

## The no-logic rule

Every component in `src/components/**` is a stateless `const` arrow function. Render output derives from props and nothing else.

Banned inside the design system:

- `useState`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useRef` for behaviour: any hook that creates state or side effects.
- Data fetching, `async`, promises, timers.
- Translation lookups. Components receive final display strings (`title`, `label`, `description`) as props; the page shell resolves translations upstream.
- Business decisions. A component may map a typed prop to a class string (`variant → classes`); it may not decide *which* variant applies: that decision arrives as a prop.
- Imperative DOM access, `window`/`document`, global side effects.
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on raw strings. If a prop is HTML, it crosses a `SanitizedHtml` checkpoint upstream (see `references/security.md`), the prop type says so.

The test: could this component render in Storybook with nothing but hardcoded props? If anything else is needed (a provider, a router, an env var, a fetch), logic has leaked in.

### The interactivity ladder

"No logic" does not mean "no interactivity". Reach for these in order:

1. **Native HTML first.** Disclosure widgets are `<details>`/`<summary>`; styling reacts with CSS (`group-open:rotate-180`). Hover and focus states are CSS. Zero JavaScript, zero props, accessible by default.

```tsx
// organisms/faq: an accordion with no state anywhere
<details className="group rounded-md border border-primary-200 p-6">
  <summary className="flex cursor-pointer list-none items-center justify-between">
    <span>{item.question}</span>
    <ChevronDownIcon className="transition-transform group-open:rotate-180" />
  </summary>
  <p className="mt-4">{item.answer}</p>
</details>
```

2. **Hoisted state via props.** When JS state is genuinely needed (mobile menu, dropdown), the component receives the state and its transitions as props, `isOpen: boolean` plus `onToggle: () => void`, and stays pure:

```tsx
export type LanguageSwitcherProps = {
  currentLang: string;
  languages: LanguageItem[];
  label?: string;
  isOpen: boolean;          // state lives upstream
  onToggle: () => void;     // transition lives upstream
};
```

3. **The state itself lives in `src/lib/hooks/`,** consumed by the page shell, never by a component:

```ts
// src/lib/hooks/use-nav-state.ts
export const useNavState = (): NavState => {
  const [mobileMenuOpen, setMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false);
  const [languageSwitcherIsOpen, setLanguageSwitcherIsOpen] = useState(false);
  return {
    mobileMenuOpen,
    languageSwitcherIsOpen,
    handleMobileMenuToggle: (): void => setMobileMenuOpen(!mobileMenuOpen),
    handleLanguageSwitcherToggle: (): void => setLanguageSwitcherIsOpen(!languageSwitcherIsOpen),
  };
};
```

Visibility toggles with classes (`hidden`, `block`, conditional class strings), not by mounting/unmounting whole subtrees where a class would do.

## Framework pieces are injected, never imported

Routing and image optimisation belong to the framework; the design system must not know which framework. Links and images arrive as component props typed against plain HTML attributes:

```tsx
// organism props: knows "a link goes here", not "Next.js exists"
export type NavBarProps = {
  brandImage: ComponentType<ImgHTMLAttributes<HTMLImageElement>>;
  brandLink: ComponentType<AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>>;
  navLinkProps: { name: string; href: string }[];
  mobileMenuOpen: boolean;
  onMobileMenuToggle: () => void;
};
```

The adapters live in `src/lib/layout/wrappers.tsx`: the one place that imports `next/link` and `next/image`:

```tsx
// src/lib/layout/wrappers.tsx
export const createLinkWrapper = (href: string): ComponentType<AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>> => {
  const isExternal = href.startsWith('http://') || href.startsWith('https://');
  const LinkWrapper: ComponentType<AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>> = ({ children, ...props }) =>
    isExternal ? (
      <Link href={href} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" {...props}>{children}</Link>
    ) : (
      <Link href={href} {...props}>{children}</Link>
    );
  LinkWrapper.displayName = `LinkWrapper(${href})`;
  return LinkWrapper;
};
```

The page shell builds the wrappers and hands them down. Render via composition: `<Item.Link>children</Item.Link>`. A component that imports `createLinkWrapper` directly has coupled itself to `src/lib`: that is the leak this pattern exists to prevent.

## Styling is sealed inside the design system

The mirror image of the no-logic rule: the application never styles anything. Tailwind (the utility classes, the responsive grammar, the token scale) exists only under `src/components/**`, plus the token sheet `app/globals.css` (Tailwind v4 CSS-first config, the rebrand lever). To the rest of the codebase, "how things look" is not a concept it can express.

- **No utility class outside the design system.** `app/**` routes, `src/page/**` shells, `src/lib/**`, `src/config/**` never contain a Tailwind string. A page shell stacks organisms inside a bare `<main>`; each organism owns its own section spacing (`py-16 lg:py-20`), so the page has nothing left to say about layout.
- **No free-form `className`/`style` in public component APIs.** Molecules and organisms expose typed props (`variant`, `size`, `tone`, content), never a class-string escape hatch. If a caller "needs" to pass a class, the design system is missing a variant: add the variant there instead.
- **Leaf atoms are the one exception.** Icons and similar primitives may accept `className` so design-system parents can size and position them (`<ChevronDownIcon className="h-5 w-5" />`). That is internal composition between design-system layers; it never crosses the app boundary.
- **Copy is plain text.** Strings in `src/config/` and `data/translations/` carry no embedded class names and no styled JSX.
- **If it needs styling, it is a design-system component.** An MDX component map, a styled prose block, a styled link: the styled implementation lives under `src/components/**`; `src/lib` composes and wires it.

Two tests, applied at review:

1. **The rebrand test.** A full visual redesign touches `src/components/**` and the tokens in `app/globals.css`: nothing else shows up in the diff.
2. **The swap test.** Migrating Tailwind to another styling engine leaves `app/`, `src/page/`, `src/lib/`, and `src/config/` byte-identical.

Why: utility classes scattered through pages are how design drift starts, three slightly different paddings for the same kind of section, a rogue `mt-7` nobody can explain. One owner for the visual layer keeps every spacing decision reviewable in one directory, and keeps application diffs about behaviour, never pixels.

## Component anatomy

```tsx
// src/components/atoms/button/index.tsx
import type { ButtonHTMLAttributes, FC, ReactNode } from 'react';

export type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'premium' | 'ghost';

export type ButtonProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
  variant?: ButtonVariant;
  icon?: ReactNode;
} & ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>;

const variantStyles: Record<ButtonVariant, string> = {
  primary: 'bg-primary-950 text-white hover:bg-primary-900',
  secondary: 'bg-transparent text-primary-900 border border-primary-300',
  premium: 'bg-accent-800 text-white hover:bg-accent-900',
  ghost: 'bg-transparent text-primary-700 hover:text-primary-950',
};

export const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant = 'primary', icon, className = '', ...props }) => {
  const variantClass = variantStyles[variant];

  return (
    <button className={`inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-x-2 rounded-md ${variantClass} ${className}`} {...props}>
      {icon && <span className="shrink-0">{icon}</span>}
      <span>{children}</span>
    </button>
  );
};

Button.displayName = 'Button';
```

Style rules, all enforced at review:

- `const` arrow function typed `FC<Props>`; never a `function` declaration (hard rule 2).
- Props type exported next to the component; `type`, never `interface` (hard rule 3).
- Group related inputs into named prop objects (`authProps`, `languageSwitcherProps`, `items`) instead of long flat lists.
- Destructure props in the parameter list; defaults in the parameter list.
- Variant/size dispatch through a `Record` keyed by the variant union, indexed directly: the typed key is the guard, and `eslint-plugin-security`'s object-injection rule is off at project level in both configs because it flags exactly this lookup (hard rule 15 forbids silencing it inline).
- Semantic elements first: `header`, `nav` with `aria-label`, `section`, `ul`/`li`, not `div` soup.
- Lists render with `.map` and stable keys (id, slug, question text), never the array index.
- Tailwind utilities on the design-token scale; **mobile first**, the base classes style the smallest screen and responsive shifts scale up via `md:*` / `lg:*`, never a desktop layout crammed down (canon 17.7, `references/product.md`).
- Accessibility is part of the contract: visible focus rings, `aria-expanded`/`aria-haspopup` on disclosure triggers, `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative SVGs.
- Named imports only: no `import * as X` wildcards.
- `displayName` on every component (and on generated wrappers).
- The `className` merge on this atom is the leaf-atom exception to the styling seal: it exists so design-system parents can size and position the primitive. The application side never passes a class through it.

## The wiring: how data reaches the design system

```
app/(en)/page.tsx                 server component, build time
  loadTranslations('en')          ── reads data/translations/en.json
  getLandingPageConfig('en')      ── src/config: copy + hrefs + image configs, typed
        │ JSON-serialisable props
        ▼
src/page/home-page.tsx            'use client' page shell
  useNavState()                   ── owns ALL state (src/lib/hooks)
  createLinkWrapper / createImageWrapper (src/lib/layout/wrappers)
        │ props only: data + callbacks + injected components
        ▼
src/components/organisms → molecules → atoms     stateless, logic-free
```

The page shell is the composition root of the UI: it is the only `'use client'` boundary, the only consumer of hooks, and the only place design-system props get assembled. `src/config/` may import design-system **prop types** (`FeaturesProps`, `TestimonialsProps`) to stay in sync with the components it feeds: types flow downward, code never does.

## Accessible by default

A user who cannot see, hear, or use a mouse is still a user, and this is law that follows the user (the EU Accessibility Act applies since mid-2025). The design system is where accessibility is won or lost, because every screen inherits what the components do (full product-side doctrine: `references/product.md`):

- **Semantic elements first.** A `<button>`, never a clickable `div`; `<details>`/`<summary>` for disclosure; `<nav>`, `<main>`, real headings in order. The interactivity ladder's "native HTML first" is accessibility by default: focus, keyboard, and roles come free.
- **Keyboard everywhere.** Every interactive component operable by keyboard alone, focus visible (`focus-visible:` styles in the component), order following the DOM. A pointer-only interaction is a broken component.
- **Contrast lives in the tokens.** Token pairs in `globals.css` (`--color-primary` with `--color-on-primary`) are chosen once to pass WCAG contrast; components consume pairs, never mix-and-match raw colours, so compliance is inherited (rule 22).
- **Labels and states are props.** Inputs get labels, icon-only buttons get an `aria-label` prop, images get meaningful `alt` (or explicit `alt=""` when decorative), busy/expanded/selected states surface as `aria-*` driven by the same props that drive the visuals.
- **Error, empty, and loading are designed states**, not afterthoughts: components expose them as typed variants so a page shell with a failed `Result` renders an explicit state instead of a blank (`references/product.md`, error copy).
- **The gate is automated.** `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` runs error-level on `src/components/**` in the canonical Next config (`references/nextjs-monorepo.md`): it fails the build on a clickable `<div>`, a control with no accessible name, a missing `alt`, or an invalid anchor, and the Next smoke test proves those rules fire. It is AST-based, so it cannot judge contrast (no layout) or focus order; those stay with the design tokens (rule 22) and review, and a runtime axe scan is the optional deeper pass a team adds when it wants dynamic-state and contrast coverage.

## Where does it go?

| You are about to write… | It belongs in |
|:---|:---|
| A reusable visual primitive (button, badge, icon) | `src/components/atoms/` |
| A grouping of atoms with one purpose (card, breadcrumbs) | `src/components/molecules/` |
| A full page section (hero, pricing, footer) | `src/components/organisms/` |
| A Tailwind utility class | inside a component under `src/components/**`, nowhere else |
| A design token (colour, spacing scale, font) | `app/globals.css` (`@theme`) |
| `useState` / `useEffect` / any hook | `src/lib/hooks/`, consumed by `src/page/` |
| A `next/link` or `next/image` usage | `src/lib/layout/wrappers.tsx`, injected as props |
| Display copy, labels, hrefs | `data/translations/` + `src/config/`, resolved by the route |
| Data loading (MDX, JSON) | server components in `app/`, at build time |
| Page assembly, state wiring | `src/page/<name>-page.tsx` |
| SEO/structured data | `src/lib/seo/`, rendered by the page shell |

When a component seems to "need" something not in this table (a store, a context, a fetch), the need is real but the location is wrong: satisfy it in the page shell and pass the result down.

## Red flags (design system)

- A hook call (any `use*`) inside `src/components/**`.
- `import ... from '../../lib/...'`, `'@/src/config/...'`, `'next/link'`, or `'next/image'` anywhere under `src/components/**`. Links and images are injected as `ComponentType` props.
- A component that resolves translations, reads `process.env`, or touches `window`.
- `'use client'` on a design-system component. The directive belongs to page shells; pure components inherit the boundary.
- A `<div onClick>` where a `<button>` or `<details>` does the job natively.
- An interactive component a keyboard cannot operate, an icon-only control without an accessible name, or a raw colour pairing that sidesteps the contrast-safe token pairs.
- Conditional `null` returns to hide content where a `hidden`/responsive class is the honest tool.
- Index keys in a `.map`.
- A new component folder without an exported props type, without `displayName`, or holding two components.
- A page shell importing an atom directly to rebuild what an organism already provides: compose at the right level instead.
- A Tailwind utility string in `app/**` (anywhere but `globals.css`), `src/page/**`, `src/lib/**`, or `src/config/**`. Styling lives only under `src/components/**`.
- A molecule or organism whose public props include `className` or `style`, or a page shell passing one in. That is a missing variant, add it to the component.
- A class name embedded in config or translation strings.
