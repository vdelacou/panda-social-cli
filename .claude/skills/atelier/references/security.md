# Security

Security guidance for Bun/TypeScript and Next.js code in the atelier style. Tuned for concrete, exploitable issues, not theoretical best-practice noise. Inspired by [anthropics/claude-code-security-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review); the false-positive filter at the bottom is adapted with credit.

## Mental model | source to sink

Every security issue is a data flow problem:

1. **Source** | untrusted input. HTTP body / query / path, cookies, headers, user-uploaded files, third-party API responses, database rows whose writer is not trusted, deserialised JSON, browser-side `postMessage`, `window.location`, URL fragments.
2. **Sink** | an operation where untrusted data is dangerous. SQL query, shell command, filesystem path, HTTP request, HTML rendering, deserialisation, template compilation, `eval`, dynamic `import`, redirect destination, cookie value, log line (for secrets only).
3. **Checkpoint** | a branded type with a validating factory that sits between source and sink. Once data has type `Email`, `SafeUrl`, or `SanitizedHtml`, downstream code can trust it.

The rule is simple: **a source must cross a checkpoint before reaching a sink**. If you cannot point to the branded-type boundary, the flow is unsafe.

## Vulnerability categories to watch

Focus on HIGH and MEDIUM findings. Skip defence-in-depth hardening, theoretical races, and patterns where exploitation is not concretely possible.

### 1. Injection

- **SQL** | always use parameterised queries. Never string-interpolate untrusted values into SQL.
- **Command** | avoid `Bun.spawn` / `child_process` with untrusted arguments entirely. If unavoidable, use the array form, never a shell string.
- **Path traversal** | reject `..`, NUL bytes, and absolute paths in filenames from users. Resolve and verify with `path.resolve` + prefix check before opening the file.
- **SSRF** | outbound HTTP destinations chosen from user input need a host allowlist and a protocol allowlist. Only flag SSRF when the host or protocol is attacker-controlled; path-only SSRF is not a vulnerability.
- **Template / eval** | never pass untrusted strings to `eval`, `new Function`, `vm.runInNewContext`, or a template engine's raw compile API.

### 2. Cross-site scripting (XSS)

- **React / Next.js** | JSX auto-escapes. A React component is safe unless it uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, renders `href={userInput}` with a `javascript:` URL, or passes untrusted HTML to a third-party renderer. Flag only those cases.
- **MDX** | content is compiled at build time. Untrusted MDX content (from users, not the repo) is dangerous and must not be rendered.
- **Response headers** | set `Content-Security-Policy` in `next.config.ts`. A strict CSP is the last line of defence.

### 3. Authentication & authorization

- **Never build the auth layer yourself (hard rule 33).** Login, sessions, token minting, and password handling are delegated to an OIDC identity provider or a vetted library; the app verifies tokens, it does not invent them. Every cloud, admin, and provider console sits behind SSO plus MFA. The auth code you hand-roll is the auth code with the subtle, expensive bug.
- **Always check on the server.** Client-side guards (disabled buttons, hidden routes) are UX, not security. The server must authenticate every request and authorise every resource access.
- **Tenant scope is part of authorization.** The owner id derives from the verified token, fails closed, and every owner-scoped endpoint ships its cross-tenant 404 test (hard rule 28; `references/isolation.md`).
- **Session cookies** | `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` or stricter, set a sensible `Max-Age`.
- **JWT** | verify the signature with a fixed algorithm list (never accept `alg: none`). Verify `exp` and `iss`. Never trust the unverified payload.
- **Insecure Direct Object References** | always check that the caller owns / can access the resource they ask for, never assume the ID in the URL is theirs to use.

### 4. Crypto & secrets

- **Never roll your own crypto.** Use `crypto.subtle` (Web Crypto API, built into Bun) or a well-known library.
- **Random** | use `crypto.randomUUID()` or `crypto.getRandomValues()`. Never `Math.random()` for tokens, IDs, nonces.
- **Password hashing** | `argon2id` or `bcrypt` at a sensible cost factor. Never SHA-256 / MD5 / any fast hash.
- **TLS verification** | never disable certificate verification in production clients.
- **Secrets in code** | no API keys, tokens, passwords, or private keys in source. Ever. Read `process.env` only inside the validated config module at the composition root, then thread the values as parameters, never sprinkle `process.env` across the codebase, and never mutate it (SKILL.md, Security).

### 5. Data exposure

- **Sensitive data in logs** | never log passwords, session tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, credit card numbers, or full PII records. Logging a URL or a user ID is fine; logging the `Authorization` header is not. Redact at the logger layer with a Winston format, not at every call site.
- **Error messages** | do not leak stack traces, internal paths, or SQL error messages to the client in production. Return a generic error and log the detail server-side.
- **Debug endpoints** | never expose `/debug`, `/__introspection`, or GraphQL introspection in production.

### 6. Deserialisation

- **JSON** | `JSON.parse` of untrusted input is safe for shape, but the result is still untrusted data: validate the shape with a branded-type factory or a schema (zod, valibot).
- **YAML** | `safe` mode only. Never `yaml.load` without a schema: YAML can instantiate arbitrary objects.
- **`node:vm` / `eval`** | never on untrusted input.

### 7. Supply chain

- `bun.lock` is committed. Review diffs on lockfile changes.
- Never install a package you have not heard of or cannot quickly verify on npm or its source repo.
- Pin versions in production images. Use `bun install --frozen-lockfile` in CI.
- Known CVEs are scanned continuously (`bun audit` in CI, daily plus on dependency PRs; `references/workflow.md`), and automated updates keep pins current so a pinned version never rots into a known-vulnerable one.
- Release artifacts are immutable, digest-addressed, signed, and carry an SBOM, so only trusted unmodified builds reach production (`references/delivery.md`, Release artifacts).

### 8. AI/LLM data flows

Untrusted content is not instructions. Anything a model reads (a document, an email, a page, a tool result) can carry orders trying to jump from the data channel into the command channel: the same disease as SQL injection, fenced and enforced the same way. Content is quoted as data; the model's output is itself an untrusted source that crosses a checkpoint; and any model-requested action is validated and authorized server-side against the actual caller's rights, because the model's confidence is not a credential (hard rule 32). Full doctrine and examples: `references/ai.md`.

## Branded types for trust boundaries

The existing value-object pattern extends naturally to security. The factory is the checkpoint; the branded type is the proof that the check ran.

```ts
// URL validated for SSRF-safety (allowlisted hosts, only https)
const ALLOWED_HOSTS = new Set(['api.example.com', 'cdn.example.com']);

export type SafeUrl = string & { readonly __brand: 'SafeUrl' };
export type SafeUrlError = { readonly kind: 'malformed' | 'protocol' | 'host'; readonly value: string };

// A sink guard reads untrusted input, so it is the boundary tier: parseSafeUrl returns
// Result (rules 16-17) and the try/catch around the native thrower is the rule 17 carve-out.
export const parseSafeUrl = (value: string): Result<SafeUrl, SafeUrlError> => {
  try {
    const url = new URL(value);
    if (url.protocol !== 'https:') return err({ kind: 'protocol', value });
    if (!ALLOWED_HOSTS.has(url.host)) return err({ kind: 'host', value });
    return ok(url.href as SafeUrl);
  } catch {
    return err({ kind: 'malformed', value });
  }
};

// only fetchers typed to accept SafeUrl can be called, grep catches every bypass; an adapter
// like any other (src/infra/**): a deadline on the call (rule 29) and a Result, never a throw (rule 16)
type FetchError = { readonly kind: 'http'; readonly status: number } | { readonly kind: 'network'; readonly message: string };

export const fetchJson = async (url: SafeUrl): Promise<Result<unknown, FetchError>> => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(2_000) });
    if (!response.ok) return err({ kind: 'http', status: response.status });
    return ok(await response.json());
  } catch (error) {
    return err({ kind: 'network', message: formatError(error) });
  }
};
```

```ts
// HTML that has been sanitised for rendering via dangerouslySetInnerHTML.
// DOMPurify needs a DOM: in the browser it uses the real one; server-side
// (Bun, static export, route handlers) `isomorphic-dompurify` bundles a jsdom
// window for you, but that pulls jsdom in as a dependency (weigh it against the
// lazy ladder). Prefer sanitising at render in a client boundary where a real DOM exists.
import DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';

export type SanitizedHtml = string & { readonly __brand: 'SanitizedHtml' };

export const sanitizedHtml = (raw: string): SanitizedHtml =>
  DOMPurify.sanitize(raw) as SanitizedHtml;
```

```ts
// Env var that must exist, must be non-empty, never leaks into logs
export type EnvVar = string & { readonly __brand: 'EnvVar' };

export const envVar = (name: string): EnvVar => {
  const value = process.env[name];
  if (value === undefined || value.length === 0) throw new Error(`Missing env var: ${name}`);
  return value as EnvVar;
};

// coerced + validated siblings: same gate at the env boundary, narrower output type
export const envNumber = (name: string): number => {
  const value = Number(envVar(name));
  if (!Number.isFinite(value)) throw new Error(`Env var ${name} is not a finite number`);
  return value;
};

export const envEnum = <T extends string>(name: string, allowed: readonly T[]): T => {
  const value = envVar(name);
  if (!allowed.includes(value as T)) throw new Error(`Env var ${name} must be one of: ${allowed.join(', ')}`);
  return value as T;
};

// Build the config record ONCE, at the composition root, then inject it as a
// dependency: do not import an env-reading singleton from arbitrary modules
// (that reads real process.env at import time, which leaks into every test that
// touches the importer). readConfig() lives in src/composition/**; use-cases and
// adapters receive `config` (or the single value they need) as a parameter.
export type AppConfig = {
  readonly apiToken: EnvVar;
  readonly databaseUrl: EnvVar;
  readonly logLevel: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'debug';
  readonly port: number;
};

export const readConfig = (): AppConfig => ({
  apiToken: envVar('API_TOKEN'),
  databaseUrl: envVar('DATABASE_URL'),
  logLevel: envEnum('LOG_LEVEL', ['error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug'] as const),
  port: envNumber('PORT'),
});
```

`envVar` brands the string because a raw `string` could bypass the non-empty check; the coerced siblings return their **natural** narrow types (`envNumber` a `number`, `envEnum` the literal union), which you wrap into a domain brand (`Port`, `TimeoutMs`) only where the value carries domain meaning (hard rule 12). A connection string consumed by a driver stays an `EnvVar`; a URL that will reach `fetch` goes through `parseSafeUrl` (above), not `envVar`. The one call to `readConfig()` belongs at the composition root; everything downstream takes the value as a parameter (SKILL.md, Security, never sprinkle `process.env`). When env outgrows a handful of vars or needs cross-field rules, parse it once there with a Zod schema instead, `const Env = z.object({ PORT: z.coerce.number().int().positive(), LOG_LEVEL: z.enum(['error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug']) }).parse(process.env)`, same principle either way: parse once, at the edge, fail loud at startup, inject downstream.

```ts
// file path that is guaranteed to live under a given root
import path from 'node:path';

export type SafePath = string & { readonly __brand: 'SafePath' };
export type SafePathError = { readonly kind: 'nul' | 'traversal'; readonly requested: string };

export const parseSafePath = (root: string, requested: string): Result<SafePath, SafePathError> => {
  if (requested.includes('\0')) return err({ kind: 'nul', requested });
  const resolved = path.resolve(root, requested);
  if (!resolved.startsWith(`${path.resolve(root)}${path.sep}`)) return err({ kind: 'traversal', requested });
  return ok(resolved as SafePath);
};
```

The pattern is the same every time: one boundary factory that parses untrusted input into a `Result`, one branded type, one truthful name (`parseX` parses, `x()` asserts a value already proven; SKILL.md, Value objects at trust boundaries). Callers cannot accidentally bypass the check because TypeScript rejects the raw `string`, and the failure travels as a value the use-case pattern-matches instead of an exception it would have to catch.

### The trust-zone test (rule 12 in full)

Wrap every domain primitive that crosses a trust boundary or feeds a dangerous sink in a branded type with a validating factory: tokens, secrets, URLs that reach `fetch`, paths that reach the filesystem, HTML that reaches the DOM, env-var values, money amounts, emails, phone numbers, ISO codes, ids whose validity is enforced (UUID-shaped, say). The factory is the validation gate; once a value has type `Email`, downstream code trusts it.

Inside a single trust boundary the rule stops: in a CLI where the user has already provided every argument through a validated Zod schema, ids that are slotted straight into a URL template may stay plain `string`, because minting one branded type per Graph-API id gives ceremony without security value when the only "source" is the user's own terminal. The test: would interpolating this value into a sink without a checkpoint create an exploitable category? If yes, brand. If no (the value already crossed a checkpoint upstream and is travelling inside one trust zone), a plain `string` is honest and lighter. The factory shapes are the two-tier pair from `references/clean-code.md` (calisthenics rule 3): `parseX` for untrusted input, returning `Result`; `x()` asserting a value already proven.

## Secrets and configuration

**Never commit:**
- `.env*` files (already gitignored).
- Service-account JSON (Firebase, GCP, AWS). Add `*-service-account*.json` to `.gitignore`.
- Private keys, certificates, SSH keys.
- API tokens, database passwords, OAuth client secrets, signing keys.
- Lockfile entries that contain credentials (some tools leak auth tokens into `.npmrc` or similar, audit before committing).

**Read only through a validated config module** (see `envVar` above). Never sprinkle `process.env.X` across the codebase.

**Secrets live in a managed store, centrally controlled.** Runtime secrets come from a secret manager (or the platform's injected equivalent), not from files a human passes around; no single person holds the key that unlocks everything; the strongest secret is one generated by automation, rotated on a schedule, and never read by a human. When one leaks: rotate it first, then purge the history (`references/workflow.md`, Commit identity, documents the history-rewrite mechanics and why cached commits stay exposed), because deleting today's copy does not un-leak it.

**Logging discipline:**
```ts
// redact at the logger layer once; every call site benefits
// src/infra/logger.ts: adapter factory, wired once at composition (hard rule 4), never a module-level singleton
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston';

// every key lowercase: the lookup lowercases the field name, so a camelCase entry ('apiKey')
// never matched and API keys were logged in clear
const REDACTED_KEYS = new Set(['password', 'token', 'authorization', 'apikey', 'secret', 'email', 'phone']); // secrets plus natural identifiers (rule 27); extend with the domain's own (name, address, ssn)

const redactFormat = format((info) => {
  for (const key of Object.keys(info)) {
    if (REDACTED_KEYS.has(key.toLowerCase())) info[key] = '[REDACTED]';
  }
  return info;
});

export const createWinstonLogger = (level: string): Logger =>
  createLogger({
    level,
    format: format.combine(redactFormat(), format.json()),
    transports: [new transports.Console()],
  });
```

Never interpolate secrets into log messages (`logger.info('token ' + token)`). Use structured logging and let the redactor do its job. The same redaction layer covers personal data: natural identifiers (email, phone, name) join the redacted key set, and only opaque internal ids are loggable (hard rule 27; `references/privacy.md`).

## One security baseline (server surfaces)

Protection is the default on every route and every environment, never a per-route memory exercise:

- **Authenticated by default.** The deny-by-default policy applies app-wide (baseline middleware in a Bun server, `quarkus.security.jaxrs.default-roles-allowed=**` in Java, which `references/java-quarkus.md` details); public endpoints (health probes, a landing page) are the explicit, allow-listed exception with a one-line reason.
- **Encrypted transport everywhere**, certificates issued and renewed by the platform (`references/delivery.md`, Automatic TLS).
- **Abuse controls as baseline**: rate limits and allow/deny lists applied globally, inherited by every route. On metered AI endpoints a rate limit is not enough; add the per-caller spend gate (`references/ai.md`).
- **Only the app is public.** Databases, caches, queues, internal services, and admin panels live on a private network, reachable only from your own services; a datastore answering connections from the whole internet is a breach waiting for a scanner. The IaC layer owns this (`references/delivery.md`).

One baseline for every project, not standards that drift per repo: this section plus the categories above are that baseline.

## One inspectable edge, no reachable origin (canon 5.10)

The private network above is only half the rule. Public traffic funnels through a **single filtering edge** (a WAF or the platform's managed gateway) that inspects, rate-limits, and blocks before anything reaches your code, and the **origin is locked to that edge**: it lives in the private subnets, has no public address, and accepts connections only from the edge. A filter you can sidestep by hitting the origin's IP is theater. Where the network cannot guarantee it, the origin verifies a shared edge secret too, defense in depth on top of the network:

```ts
// the origin refuses anything that did not pass the edge; unreachable looks absent (7.1), not forbidden
app.use('*', (c, next) =>
  c.req.header('x-edge-secret') === env.EDGE_SECRET ? next() : c.text('not found', 404));
```

The edge is the one place this pillar's rate limits (5.7) and pillar 10's call deadlines (10.13) live, every public request passing through it. The origin lock itself is infrastructure (`references/delivery.md`); a fully managed gateway with no separately addressable origin already satisfies the rule.

## Next.js specifics

- **`output: 'export'`** | static export means no runtime server code. There is no backend to defend in-package; every auth check must happen at your actual backend (Firebase, Cloud Run, etc.). Do not assume Next.js will filter anything at runtime.
- **CSP** | set `Content-Security-Policy` via `next.config.ts` `headers()`. Strict policy: no `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts, explicit allowlist for any CDN.
- **Images** | `images.unoptimized: true` (required for static export) means no server-side image sanitisation. Treat user-uploaded images as hostile; if you render them, do so only inside `<img>` with explicit dimensions, never via CSS `background-image` with user input.
- **MDX** | only render MDX sourced from your repository's `data/` folder. Never render user-submitted MDX.
- **Environment variables** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables ship to the browser. Never put secrets there.
- **Cookies** | set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` on any auth cookie. Use `SameSite=Lax` at minimum.

## Security review checklist (pre-merge)

Run through this before approving a change that touches trust boundaries:

1. **Sources identified** | for every new input, where does it come from? User, network, filesystem, environment, database?
2. **Sinks identified** | for every new output or operation, what consumes the data? SQL, shell, HTTP, filesystem, HTML, redirect, cookie, log?
3. **Checkpoints in place** | between each source and sink, is there a branded-type validating factory? If not, why not?
4. **authN/Z on the server** | if this is a backend change, is the check at the server boundary, not the client?
5. **No secrets leaked** | no new `console.log` of tokens; no new fields added to log objects without considering redaction; no secrets in source or in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
6. **Dependencies reviewed** | did this PR change `bun.lock`? Are the new packages trustworthy?
7. **Error handling** | do errors avoid leaking stack traces or SQL messages to the client?
8. **Bypass tested** | for a new or changed authz surface, do tests assert the refusals (wrong role 403, missing token 401, cross-tenant 404, forged trust header inert)? See `references/testing.md` (Bypass tests).
9. **PII channels clean** | no personal data added to a log field, URL, query string, or third-party event (hard rule 27; `references/privacy.md`).

If the PR does not cross a trust boundary (pure refactor, domain logic, test changes), skip this checklist.

## Deep analysis before a release

For larger changes or a pre-release audit, install Anthropic's `/security-review` slash command from [anthropics/claude-code-security-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review). Run it against the PR branch: it applies a stricter confidence threshold, a vetted false-positive filter, and a structured report format. It complements this reference rather than replacing it.

## False-positive filter (strict, adopt when reviewing)

When reviewing code for security issues, apply the same discipline the agent at `anthropics/claude-code-security-review` uses. Do NOT report:

1. Denial-of-Service or resource-exhaustion patterns. Only flag concrete, high-impact exploits.
2. A lack of hardening measures. Flag concrete vulnerabilities, not missing defence-in-depth.
3. Race conditions or timing attacks that are theoretical.
4. Outdated third-party libraries (that is a separate dependency-management concern).
5. Memory-safety issues in memory-safe languages.
6. Log spoofing, or logging of non-PII user input.
7. SSRF where only the path is attacker-controlled (host and protocol must be).
8. Including user-controlled content in AI prompts.
9. Regex injection or regex-DOS.
10. Findings in documentation (`.md` files, comments).
11. Lack of audit logs.
12. Open redirects, tab-nabbing, XS-Leaks, prototype pollution, unless extremely high confidence.
13. XSS in React or Angular components that do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `bypassSecurityTrustHtml`, or similar explicit escape hatches.
14. GitHub Actions workflow issues unless a concrete untrusted-input path is demonstrated.
15. Client-side-only authN/Z gaps (client code is not a trust boundary).
16. Command injection in shell scripts not driven by untrusted input.
17. Logging URLs, UUIDs, or environment-variable values (treated as trusted).
18. Unit-test code.

**Nuance on item 8** | user content flowing *into* a prompt is not a finding by itself. What IS a finding: model output reaching a sink or executing a tool without a validation checkpoint and server-side authorization for the actual caller (hard rule 32; `references/ai.md`). That path has a concrete attack story; the prompt contents alone do not.

**Confidence threshold** | only report a finding if you are at least 80% confident it is concretely exploitable. If you cannot describe the attack in one sentence, it is not a finding.

**Severity scale:**
- **HIGH** | directly exploitable, leads to RCE, data breach, auth bypass, privilege escalation.
- **MEDIUM** | exploitable under specific realistic conditions, significant impact.
- **LOW** | skip, unless the user has explicitly asked for a full defence-in-depth pass.

**Report format** (when producing a security review):

```markdown
# <category>: `<file>:<line>`

* Severity: High | Medium
* Description: <one sentence; what the vulnerability is>
* Exploit scenario: <concrete attack in 1-2 sentences>
* Recommendation: <specific fix; name the branded type or library>
```

Noise costs trust. Err on the side of not reporting.
