# panda-social-cli

Post text, an image, or both to Threads, X, Facebook Pages and Instagram from one command line or one TypeScript library. It is built for AI agents first: every command answers in JSON, and every error names its cause and the next step to fix it.

> Status: under construction. The first slice, Threads, is in progress. Nothing is published to npm yet.

## What each platform allows

The CLI can only do what each platform's API permits. As of September 2026:

| Platform | Text only | Local image | Edit | Delete | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Threads | yes, 500 characters | public URL only | no, `--repost` deletes and republishes | yes, 100 a day | free |
| X | yes, 280 characters | direct upload | X Premium only, within 1 hour | yes | pay-per-use credits |
| Facebook Page | yes | direct upload | posts made by this app | yes | free |
| Instagram | no | public URL only, JPEG | no | with Facebook Login only | free |
