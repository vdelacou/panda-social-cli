# Block commits exceeding 10 files OR 300 lines (insertions + deletions).
#
# Why these thresholds: small commits are easier to review, revert, and
# bisect. Large commits hide bugs (one slip across 300 lines is hard to
# spot). Every commit on `main` becomes git history that the next engineer
# reads: keep each one a coherent slice.
#
# The thresholds are conservative because they force the discipline.
# Loosening them undermines the rule. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`
# only for genuine big-bang changes (initial scaffolds, mass-renames,
# generated files); justify every bypass in the commit body.
#
# See skills/atelier/references/workflow.md (Commit size limits).
