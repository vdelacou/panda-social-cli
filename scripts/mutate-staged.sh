# Run Stryker mutation testing on STAGED files in the mutation scope

#
# An optional local pre-check (`bun run mutate:staged`); the enforcing home is
# CI (`mutate:changed` on every pull request and push; the full `mutate` sweep
# is the daily assets/mutation.yml). Never wired into the hook. Skips with exit 0 when no relevant
# files are staged, so commits that touch only docs, tests, or scripts are
# unaffected.

# test-only change, strengthening an assertion without touching the source,
# does not invalidate it and the score reports stale. A commit gate must judge
# the current tree, so --force ignores cached statuses. Prefer it to deleting
# reports/stryker-incremental.json: that path is owned by stryker.conf.json
# via `incrementalFile`, so a config change silently turns the delete into a
# no-op and the stale-score trap returns.
